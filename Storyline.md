 Chapter 1
The story starts on Utsukushii Yozora's 13th birthday...
"Mom I'm off," Yozora said.
"Good luck Hoshimi."   
They stood in the giant field, the wind blowing wildly. Other students like her said good bye to their parents and frantically ran to the cliff. 
"Wait, mom I see no tra-." Yozora yelled.
A bright light soon appeared behind her, steam passing by her. A giant train float mid air with a label stating "MasutƒÅtorein" hissed to a halt, a man with pinkish hair and a mustache emerging.
"Welcome to the train, I am Gumi and I will transport you to Yonaka school of assassins. Now all aboard." 
The students shuffled towards the train and so did Yozora. She put all of her luggage away and proceeded to a cabin. She enter a cabin with 3 other students.
"Hi" One of them said. The boy had half yellow and red hair hair and wore a yellow shirt with shorts. He looked happy for the moment, but radiated a slight sensation of anger. 
"Hello," Yozora replied.
"Who are you?" The boy asked.
"I'm Utsukushii Yozora, but you can call me Hoshimi," She replied.
"Hi Hoshimi, I am Akai Mame," He replied.
Utsukushii took a seat directly in front of the Akai and next to her was quiet boy staring out the window with a white jacket. He is hold something in his hand, an origami bird. 
"That boy's name is Shizukana Kodomo, he is very good at making paper origami," Mame explained, having known Kodomo for the greater part of his life.
"Who's she?" Yozora questioned, gesturing to a girl with dark brown hair and a rather cold aura. Then spotting her friend she knew as Noboru Taiyou, she saw her heading towards the girl.
Waltzing up to the girl, Taiyou tilted her head in curiosity. Poking her finger into the shoulder of the girl, she attempted to break the cold ice emitting from the girl. Having absolutely no reaction, she tried again, hoping to get a response out of the girl. Yozora spotted the threatening glare and used the nearest object; a small hardback book in her hand to save Taiyou from receiving the consequences that might follow. Smacking Taiyou's hand away from the girl with the book, she apologized to the girl, "Sorry about that, she's my idiot, what's your name?"
"Heishi. Tsuyoi Heishi."
The girl then left, without another word, yet her chilling aura remained. Seeing as though the supposed Heishi was gone, Yozora sat back down by the two boys she met earlier, accompanied by Taiyou.
Chapter 2
Sitting in her seat by Taiyou, Kodomo, and Mame, Yozora observed from the window as the train began to pick up speed. Then, something peculiar happened, the train flew through the air, the clear water below twinkling from the sun. The train went swerved left and right, gliding with the wind surrounding it. Gaining more speed by the second, the train rose until they were under the clouds. Yozora noticed that they were far from land and in moments it disappeared in an instant behind the clouds they flew up above. Swiftly gliding above the pillow-like clouds, Yozora peered out the window, curious about the now visible island below. The train owned by YSA began descending from the air, gently diving down toward the Earth below. The train dropped lower and lower not stopping no place visible.   Yozora closed her eyes holding for dear life, screams could be heard from the first year boxes. Everything stop falling, then a jolt, then
SCREEEEEEE
The train screeched to a stop, and the conductor motioned for the students to leave. Gathering her luggage, she joined her three friends and classmates. The station was fairly large with pillars made out of marble and a gold arch leading to the outside. A woman stood in front of the gate rounding up the students.
"Hello students, I'm Ren and I will be leading you to the dining hall for today. After you all have eaten, you will be taken to the dorms for room assignments."
 The students marched into the giant campus that is expanding everywhere in a giant cavern. Peeping out of the windows that lined the hallway, Yozora spotted an oldy lush courtyard with a path leading inside a large mansion. All the students marched outside and some how its light as day inside the cavern. They entered the mansion then took a sharp turn, passing a door slightly opened that showed a library filled with all types of books, complete with comfy chairs and a fireplace with a burning  fire. Then a maintenance  room was seen ever so slightly before they stopped at the food court with outdoor compartments and a  counter with a man with a tall hat. The older students went ahead of the first years to get their food first, having understood how everything was laid out.
"Now students, you may walk to our chef and tell him what you want and take a seat." Ren instructed.
Mame went first out of the four of them, "Spicy Yaki Udon please sir."
Next was Yozora, "Takikomi Gohan, please."
	The tall chef flicked his wrist and a very detailed Takikomi Gohan appeared on the counter in front of her. Then, grabbing her bowl of the rice dish, she found her three friends from earlier, the only ones she knew other than Tsuyoi Heishi. Throughout their meal, Taiyou and Mame chatted with Yozora. Kodomo stayed quite silent, only speaking at a few instances and choosing to make a small origami sword as he consumed his dinner.
Chapter 3
"Welcome new students to Yonaka school for Assassins. I am Kenmaina Riida , the headmaster of this school."
"I would like to introduce the first years to their teachers. Ren will be teaching how to use your spirits to gain and use your Okurimono. Ken will help you with combat in the court yard. If you have any questions about the grounds or the system you can ask Mr. Gumi. "
"You will also be learning other basic skills like battle planning with Mrs. Tsubuyaku or learning your average school subjects with the other teachers," Mr. Riida explained as a wave of groans filled the room at the mention of regular school subjects.
After dinner it was extremely late and the four grouped together with the other students and followed Ren. Ren led them to the library which had a warm and sweet aroma and a burning fire that was rumored to never go out. They went up a set of stairs to an area with two doors with a dimly lit candle between. 
"The girls will be on the left and the boys will be on the right." Ren instructed.
"Please take a paper for your schedule, then go into your rooms and get some rest. "

Yozora scanned her and Taiyou's papers, pleased to have the same schedule and dorm room. The two entered the main room for the girls, which had both traditional seating and large sofas. The set up seemed quite comfortable with a small kitchen on the side and stairs leading up to the dorms. Heading up the stairs she went down a long and stretched out hallway before arriving at Dorm 28. opening the door, she found a few huge surprises. Tsuyoi Heishi, the girl from earlier, was sitting upon a bed in the corner of the room and had been assigned as the third member of Dorm 28. 
Oh, joy. Sarai thought, remembering the last time she'd seen the girl.
